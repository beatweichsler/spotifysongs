# Popularity Predictor: Analyzing and Predicting Popularity Metrics

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting popularity metrics using machine learning techniques. Developed as part of an academic assignment by a team of students, it leverages various statistical and machine learning methods to understand and forecast the determinants of popularity across different domains.

## Repository Contents

- **Jupyter Notebook (`PopularityPredictor.ipynb`)**: Contains the code, analysis, and findings of the project.
- **Data Files**: Essential datasets used in the analysis are included. (Details on the datasets would be added based on notebook review.)

## Instructions

### Setting Up

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Ensure you have a local copy of the repository.
2. **Data Files**: Ensure all necessary data files are placed within the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook for seamless integration and analysis.

### Running the Analysis

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook**: Utilize your preferred Jupyter environment (JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, etc.) to open the `PopularityPredictor.ipynb` notebook.
2. **Execute the Notebook**: Follow through by running the cells in sequence to replicate the analysis and view the results.

## Methodology

The project embraces a comprehensive approach, starting with exploratory data analysis to understand the data's characteristics, followed by:

- **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring data quality by handling missing values and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Crafting and selecting relevant features for effective popularity prediction.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Employing various machine learning algorithms to train predictive models and assess their performance.
